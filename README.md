### Chessboard/Floodfilling Class Coloring Enhancement
## Overview
This project aims to enhance the class coloring visualizations in Chessboard and Floodfilling scenarios by introducing a customizable weighting system for color intensity. Users can choose from a selection of weightings, including SDH, inverted U-Matrix, P-Matrix, and U*-Matrix. The enhancement involves transforming the class coloring into an HSV colorspace and adjusting the saturation channel based on the selected weighting.

## Features
Selectable Weighting:

SDH (Self-organizing Document Histogram)
Inverted U-Matrix
P-Matrix
U*-Matrix
HSV Colorspace Transformation:

Class coloring is transformed into the HSV colorspace to facilitate manipulation of color channels.
Weighted Saturation Channel:

The saturation channel is adjusted according to the selected weighting, providing a more nuanced and informative visualization.
Customizable Saturation Decrease Intensity:

Users can modify the intensity of saturation decrease with decreasing weight, allowing for fine-tuning of the visualization.
## Getting Started
Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd your_project_directory
Requirements:

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
Refer to the requirements.txt file for specific package versions.
Usage:

Configure the visualization parameters in the settings file or through command-line options.
Run the application to generate the enhanced class coloring visualizations.
bash
Copy code
python enhance_visualizations.py --weighting SDH --intensity 0.8
Configuration
Adjust the following parameters in the settings file or as command-line options:

--weighting: Select the desired weighting (SDH, Inverted U-Matrix, P-Matrix, U*-Matrix).
--intensity: Set the intensity of saturation decrease with decreasing weight (0.0 to 1.0).
